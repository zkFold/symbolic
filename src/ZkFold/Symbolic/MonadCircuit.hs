-- | A type of witness builders. @i@ is a type of variables, @a@ is a base field.
--
-- A function is a witness builder if, given an arbitrary field of witnesses @x@
-- over @a@ and a function mapping known variables to their witnesses,
-- it computes the new witness in @x@.
--
-- NOTE: the property above is correct by construction for each function of a

-- | A type of constraints for new variables.
-- @i@ is a type of variables, @a@ is a base field.
--
-- A function is a constraint for a new variable if, given an arbitrary algebra
-- @x@ over @a@, a function mapping known variables to their witnesses in that
-- algebra and a new variable, it computes the value of a constraint polynomial
-- in that algebra.
--
-- NOTE: the property above is correct by construction for each function of a

-- | A monadic DSL for constructing arithmetic circuits.
-- @i@ is a type of variables, @a@ is a base field
-- and @m@ is a monad for constructing the circuit.
--
-- DSL provides the following guarantees:
--
-- * There are no unconstrained variables;
-- * Variables with equal constraints and witnesses are reused as much as possible;
-- * Variables with either different constraints or different witnesses are different;
-- * There is an order in which witnesses can be generated;
-- * Constraints never reference undefined variables.
--
-- However, DSL does NOT provide the following guarantees (yet):
--
-- * That provided witnesses satisfy the provided constraints. To check this,
--   you can use 'ZkFold.Symbolic.Compiler.ArithmeticCircuit.checkCircuit'.
-- * That introduced constraints are supported by the zk-SNARK utilized for later proving.
